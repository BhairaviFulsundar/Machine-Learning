# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning 🤖🎗️

This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the famous **Breast Cancer Dataset (BCD)**, which contains features extracted from breast cancer biopsies to help in classification.

## Project Overview 🧠

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection can greatly improve survival rates. In this machine learning project, we apply various classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)**. The goal is to build a model that can help doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses based on cell sample features.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used is the ** Breast Cancer Dataset (BCD)**, which contains 569 instances with 32 attributes, including:
- **Diagnosis**: Whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B)
- 30 features describing the cell's nucleus, including radius, texture, smoothness, etc.

You can access the dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

### Dataset Details:
- **Target Variable**: `diagnosis` (Malignant or Benign)
- **Features**: Numerical attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## Requirements ⚙️
